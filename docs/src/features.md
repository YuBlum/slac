# Features 

- Vectors with N sizes (1 to 255)
- Vector types wrappers (vector2, vector3, vector4)
- Easy to create custom vectors types
- Vector basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Vector exclusive operations (dot, mag, dist)
- Vector X scalar operations (same as the basic operations)

# Goals

- [ ] Matrix with N rows and M columns (1 to 255, 1 to 255)
- [ ] Matrix basic operations (matrix addition and matrix subtraction)
- [ ] Matrix complex operations (multiplication, determinant, inverse)
- [ ] Built in matrix type E.g. matrix3x3
- [ ] Like vectors be easy to create new matrices types
- [ ] Transformations for 2D and 3D vectors
- [ ] Transformations for projections and views
- [ ] More optimised operations
