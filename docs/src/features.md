# Current features 

- Vectors with N sizes
- Vector types wrappers (vector2, vector3, vector4)
- Easy to create custom vectors types
- Vector basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Vector exclusive operations (dot, mag, dist, etc...)
- Vector X Scalar operations (same as the basic operations)

# Goals for the future

- Matrix with N rows and M columns
- Matrix basic operations (matrix addition and matrix subtraction)
- Matrix complex operations (multiplication, determinant, inverse)
- Built in matrix type E.g. matrix3x3
- Like vectors be easy to create new matrices types
- Transformations for 2D and 3D vectors
- Transformations for projections and views
- More optimised operations
