# Introduction

**SLAC** stands for **Simple Linear Algebra for C**, and as the name suggests this project is... a simple linear algebra library for C! To be more especific it uses the C11 standard.

## Who this library is for?

SLAC is designed to be a simple, intuitive and low memory cost linear algebra library. The fundamental principles of this library are simplicity and readability, so it may not perform best among other linear algebra libraries, but it's definitely not slow.

If you are looking for something simple, stylish and don't care so much about having the best possible performance, this library is for you!

##  Why SLAC?

In case you're thinking *"There are many linear algebra libraries out there, why I should even bother with a new one?"*... well I say you shouldn't to be honest, this library is primarily created for fun, yeah I know this is strange, but there are other reasons for the creation of SLAC as well.

All the libraries that I tested involving linear algebra so far are trying to be the most cross-platform possible, and yes I think that cross-platform is important, but I'm gonna be realistic the majority of people have a computer and an OS that supports the C11 standard and to ignore some useful features avaible in this standard just for "the sake of cross-platform" is not something I want for this library.
